# Face-Recognition
You will need this shape_predictor in order to run the program. Download [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eqelCtr_TaksnM2R3fU7QY31w1iO9YhL/view?usp=drive_link)
Also, if you want to test with your own dataset, you can update to the "database" file with your face then let the program detect it :)
